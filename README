The Checks folder contains the Checkstyle custom rules implemented in Java.

Checks/src/checks/
	- GuardMethodPattern.java
	- IdempotentPattern.java
	- SingleForLoopPattern.java


-----

The dev folder contains:
1. a copy of checkstyle-5.3
2. old code that has since been removed/replaced	
3. bash scripts to run Checkstyle
4. test directory

-----

3. The scripts are seperated into 3 folders based on the custom rules run on student submissions
	- bank account (guard method pattern)
	- idem (idempotent pattern on bank account submissions)
	- weather record (single for loop pattern)

4. The test directory contains Java files that were used for testing the custom Checkstyle rules
	- folders contain simple Java files related to each rule
	- JAR files that contain the custom rules to be run with Checkstyle
	- XML files to specify the integration of the custom rules
